                <p>Welcome!
                <br /><br />You have arrived at the portfolio website of Peter Carey, also known as Dracon Interactive.
                <br />While I *do* have a nice flashy website over at <a href="http://www.draconinteractive.com.au" target="_blank">my official website</a>, I wanted to create this area to show people interested in the technical aspects of my work.
                <br />So if you are a recruiter, a fellow programmer, or just someone trawling random website, I hope you find this site useful. 
                <br /><br />Please use the menu to the left to browse through my work. 
                <br /><br />You may notice interesting pieces around the site, such as the search bar, user page, sidebar and notifications dropdown. 
                <br />These are in active development. I am not a web dev in any form, and this website exists due to the existence <a href="https://genhttp.org/" target="_blank">GenHTTP</a>, a C# library made by an amazing developer.
                <br />This allowed me to interact with common tools, such as Scriban, Bootstrap and CSS, from within the comfort of my favourite programming language. 
                <br />So mess around with these areas! They may have static content such as text, or I might just have gotten something cool working. Either way, enjoy :)
                <br /><br />Peter Carey</p>

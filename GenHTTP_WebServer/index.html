    <p>Hi!
    <br /><br />
    My name is Peter Carey, and I am Dracon Interactive.
    <br /><br />
    I have been working as a game developer for more than 6 years, and I specialise in VR/AR development. 
    <br />
    While I am currently working full-time at St John WA as a Game Developer, I do my best to research and develop products on the side. 
    <br /> <br />
    So dig in and look around! My contact details are below, and I am always open to answer questions. 
    <br /><br />
    My most warm regards,
    <br />
    Peter

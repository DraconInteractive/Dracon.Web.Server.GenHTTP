    <p>Learn life saving First Aid skills on your phone, your computer or an Oculus Quest</p>
    <br />
    <p>This is the project I have spent the last 3 years perfecting.
    <br />
    It has been a journey of discovery, not only in programming and development, but in developing a team and working to fulfill changing requirements. 
    <br />
    The work isnt done yet though! As the field of medicine evolves, so does the information needed to be represented within this game. I look forward to making it better every day.
